<center><h1>Rap god lyrics</h1>
<p style="font-size: larger;font-style:normal;">Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings<br>
But I’m only going to get this one chance<br>
Something’s wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on)<br>
Just a feeling I’ve got, like something’s about to happen, but I don’t know what<br>
If that means, what I think it means, we’re in trouble, big trouble,<br>
And if he is as bananas as you say, I’m not taking any chances<br>
You were just what the doctor ordered<br>
    
I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?<br>
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot<br>

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes<br>
I got a laptop in my back pocket<br>
My pen’ll go off when I half-c*** it<br>
Got a fat knot from that rap profit<br>
Made a living and a killing off it<br>
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office<br>
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack<br>
I’m an MC still as honest<br>
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill ’em all with)<br>
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop<br>
You don’t really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap<br>
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac<br>
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I’m practicing<br>
That I’ll still be able to break a motherf***in’ table<br>
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half<br>
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact<br>
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack<br>
Rappers are having a rough time period, here’s a Maxipad<br>
It’s actually disastrously bad<br>
For the wack while I’m masterfully constructing this masterpiece as<br>

I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?<br>
Let me show you maintaining this s*** ain’t that hard, that hard<br>

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got<br>
Well, to be truthful the blueprint’s simply rage and youthful exuberance<br>
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance<br>
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since<br>
MC’s get taken to school with this music<br>
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme<br>
Now I lead a new school full of students<br>
Me? I’m a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-<br>
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim<br>
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position<br>
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherf***in’ Rock n’<br>
Roll Hall of Fame<br>
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames<br>
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame<br>
On the wall of shame<br>
You fags think it’s all a game ’til I walk a flock of flames<br>
Off of planking, tell me what in the f*** are you thinking?<br>
Little gay looking boy<br>
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy<br>
You witnessing a massacre<br>
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy<br>
Oy vey, that boy’s gay, that’s all they say looking boy<br>
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back<br>
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy<br>
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?<br>
I got a “hell yeah” from Dre looking boy<br>
I’mma work for everything I have<br>
Never ask nobody for s***, get outta my face looking boy<br>
Basically boy you’re never gonna be capable<br>
To keep up with the same pace looking boy<br>

‘Cause I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>
The way I’m racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar<br>
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God<br>
Kneel before General Zod this planet’s Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard<br>

So you be Thor and I’ll be Odin, you rodent, I’m omnipotent<br>
Let off then I’m reloading immediately with these bombs I’m totin’<br>
And I should not be woken<br>
I’m the walking dead, but I’m just a talking head, a zombie floating<br>
But I got your mom deep throating<br>
I’m out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle<br>
I’m a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil<br>
It’s me, my honesty’s brutal<br>
But it’s honestly futile if I don’t utilize what I do though<br>
For good at least once in a while<br>
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle<br>
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times<br>
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned<br>
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it’s lunchtime<br>
I know there was a time where once I<br>
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I’m on my Pharoahe Monch grind<br>
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine<br>
Appeal with the skin color of mine<br>
You get too big and here they come trying to,<br>
Censor you like that one line I said on “I’m Back” from the Marshall Mathers LP<br>
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine<br>
Put ’em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine<br>
See if I get away with it now that I ain’t as big as I was, but I’ve<br>
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal<br>
You’re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though<br>
And I don’t know what the f*** that you rhyme for<br>
You’re pointless as Rapunzel with f***ing cornrows<br>
You’re like normal, f*** being normal<br>
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future<br>
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad<br>
‘Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad<br>
Singin’ to a man while they played piano<br>
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel<br>
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day<br>
“Hey, Fab, I’mma kill you”<br>
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)<br>
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you a**uming I’m a human<br>
What I gotta do to get it through to you I’m superhuman<br>
Innovative and I’m made of rubber<br>
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it’ll glue to you<br>
I’m never stating, more than never demonstrating<br>
How to give a motherf***in’ audience a feeling like it’s levitating<br>
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting<br>
For the day that they can say I fell off, they’d be celebrating<br>
Cause I know the way to get ’em motivated<br>
I make elevating music, you make elevator music<br>
Oh, he’s too mainstream<br>
Well, that’s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it<br>
It’s not hip hop, it’s pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it<br>
With rock, shock rap with Doc<br>
Throw on Lose Yourself and make ’em lose it<br>
I don’t know how to make songs like that<br>
I don’t know what words to use<br>
Let me know when it occurs to you<br>
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you<br>
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin’ you<br>
How many verses I gotta murder to,<br>
Prove that if you’re half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!<br>
School flunkie, pill junky<br>
But look at the accolades the skills brung me<br>
Full of myself, but still hungry<br>
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to<br>
And I’m a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues<br>
But it’s still tongue in cheek, f*** you<br>
I’m drunk so Satan take the f***ing wheel, I’m asleep in the front seat<br>
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky<br>
But in my head there’s something I can feel tugging and struggling<br>
Angels fight with devils, here’s what they want from me<br>
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate<br>
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had<br>
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation<br>
And understand the discrimination<br>
But f*** it, life’s handing you lemons, make lemonade then<br>
But if I can’t batter the women how the f*** am I supposed to bake them a cake then?<br>
Don’t mistake it for Satan<br>
It’s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas<br>
And take a vacation to trip a broad<br>
And make her fall on her face and don’t be a retard<br>
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?<br>
